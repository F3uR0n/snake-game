# 🐍 Snake Game (Python)

A classic **Snake game** built using **Python and the Turtle graphics module**.
Guide the snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with walls or itself. This project demonstrates game logic, animation, collision detection, and user input handling in Python.

## 🎮 Game Overview

* 🐍 Control a snake that moves around the screen
* 🍎 Eat food to grow longer
* ⛔ Avoid hitting boundaries or the snake’s own body
* 🏆 Score increases with every food eaten
* ⏱️ Game speeds up as you progress

---

## ✨ Features

* Arrow key controls
* Dynamic snake growth and movement
* Food spawns at random positions
* Collision detection (wall + self)
* Real-time scoreboard
* Increasing difficulty

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.x**
* **Turtle graphics** for visuals
* Core concepts:

  * Game loop
  * Keyboard event handling
  * Collision detection
  * Random placement

## 🎮 Controls

| Action     | Key            |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| Move Up    | ⬆️ Up Arrow    |
| Move Down  | ⬇️ Down Arrow  |
| Move Left  | ⬅️ Left Arrow  |
| Move Right | ➡️ Right Arrow |

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The snake moves continuously via the game loop.
2. Arrow keys change direction.
3. Food randomly appears on screen.
4. When snake collides with food:

   * Score increases
   * Food respawns
   * Snake grows
5. Collision with wall or self ends the game.

## 🚧 Limitations

* No pause feature
* No sound effects
* Fixed grid movement
* No menu or difficulty selection

---

## 🌱 Future Improvements

* 🔊 Add sound effects
* ⏸️ Pause / resume controls
* 📊 High score saving
* 🎮 Difficulty levels
* 🖼️ Graphics improvements
